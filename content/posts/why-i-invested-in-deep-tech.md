I want to build a future in which I'm excited to live. The most exciting changes in the world since I was born were created by Startups.  Here are some things that were not possible when I was born:

* All the worlds information at my fingertips
* Find and connect to anyone in the whole world
* Listen to any song I want
* Have enough Movies to fill my entire life
* Bringing a whole library with me all the time

It is becoming increasingly popular to put the blame of everything wrong with society on tech companies. From hate and misinformation up to war and inequality, everything seems to be tech's fault. I think this is a big mistake.

Now it's the best time to be born. If you could not choose where and to which family you would be born but could choose a time, there is no better time than now. A random baby being born today have better prospects than in any previous period of history. The chances of dying from hunger, disease, or war have never been lower. Not only that, but the chance of getting an education and a prosperous life has never been better.

Technology Startups create more solutions than problems. I believe they bring a net positive to the world. The world needs more technology and more startups, not less. 

I invest in startups because they are a net positive good to the world. 

The category of startups I'm most excited about is Deep Tech.
Deep Tech Startups are companies bringing new technology to the market. They are startups that have more technical risk than market risk while software startups have low technological risk but high market risk. 

A new food delivery startup would not fail because it was impossible to develop the app but most likely because it didn't find enough customers. Technology is not the most significant risk; the biggest risk in a traditional software startup is making something no one wants. 

A startup developing a novel drug for a deadly genetic disease would hardly fail because no one wants the treatment. The challenge would be to make the "product" itself more than the market. Technology is the biggest risk here. 

Technological progress is not guaranteed. We need to plan and work towards it. Peter Thiel in Zero to One talks about the importance of having an optimistic definite vision of the future:

> To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to improve it. From the 17th century through the 1950s and ’60s, definite optimists led the Western world. Scientists, engineers, doctors, and businessmen made the world richer, healthier, and more long-lived than previously imaginable. 

Thiel claims that since the 80s, the world has been dominated by "indefinite optimists":

> Instead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite optimists rearrange already-invented ones. Bankers make money by rearranging the capital structures of already existing companies. Lawyers resolve disputes over old things or help other people structure their affairs. And private equity investors and management consultants don’t start new businesses; they squeeze extra efficiency from old ones with incessant procedural optimizations.

It’s easy for cynicism about the world and our ability to change it to prevent us from making big concrete plans for the future, or worse, from imagining a future that is better in some big, tangible way from the present. This diminishing of imagination is a real tragedy. 

I grew up reading science fiction stories. Those stories had a vision of a future with robots, cheap energy, space exploration, and virtual reality. This is the future I want to live in. Deep Tech startups are working to make this sci-fi future a reality. 

I believe humanity's future is bright, but believing is not enough. We need to plan, and we need to act. The best time to start is now.
